# FlightLogger

FlightLogger is a sophisticated Single Page Application (SPA) built with Next.js and MongoDB, designed for pilots to efficiently create and manage their flight log entries.

## Update in Progress 🚀

> [!NOTE]
> I am currently enhancing FlightLogger to incorporate Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices. The upcoming updates will include:
   > - Containerization with Docker
   > - Deployment to Kubernetes
   > - Orchestrating containers using Kubernetes for scalability and high availability.
   > - Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
   > - Implementing real-time monitoring, metrics collection, and visualization dashboards.
   > - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
   > - Configuring Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale resources based on demand.
   > - Integrating a logging solution for better observability and easier troubleshooting.
   > - Setting up alerts to proactively notify about system issues or performance bottlenecks.
>  
> Stay tuned for detailed updates and documentation!

## Features

- Robust user authentication system (register/login/logout)
- Role-based access control (User and Admin roles)
- Create, read, update, and delete flight log entries
- User profile management
- Admin panel for user management
- Search and filter functionality for flight logs
- Responsive design for seamless use on both desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React
- **UI Library**: Shadcn UI
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js - API Routes, Server Actions (Express is installed but never used, instead opted for Server Actions)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Form Handling**: react-hook-form with Zod validation
- **State Management**: React Context API

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- MongoDB (local instance or cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-logger.git
cd flight-logger
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install or yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
AUTH_SECRET=anystring
```

4. Optional - To use GithHb or Google OAuth, you would require to get auth credentials from the providers.
   Create a OAuth App on the providers and copy their IDs & Secret respectively.

For GitHub: Go to [Settings -> Developer -> OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers)

For Google: Go to [Create a Project -> APIs & Services -> OAuth Consent Screen -> External + default options](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

```
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=
```

5. Run the development server:

```
npm run dev or yarn dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

There were a few extra features implemented.

## Authentication and Authorization

FlightLogger implements authentication using [NextAuth.js V5 (Beta)](https://next-auth.js.org/). The authentication flow is handled through a combination of server-side checks and client-side route protection:

- Public routes are accessible to only logged/authenticated in users
- Auth routes (login/register) redirect authenticated users to the dashboard
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to the login page
- API routes under `/api/auth` are always accessible

## Role-Based Access Control

The application supports two user roles:

- **User**: Can manage their own flight logs and profile
- **Admin**: Has access to user management and all flight logs

> Note: Profile might have a small bug -> Refresh page and try.

## Development Practices

- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting
- Git for version control
- Modular component architecture
- Server-side rendering and API routes for improved performance and SEO

## Deployment

Application deployed on Vercel.

> Note: If you try to run `npm run build`, it would fail.
> This is due to some edge runtime errors that hasn't been fixed by Nextjs.
> Refer to this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/46722).

## Thoughts

Fun learning experience trying to learn next-auth, OAuth for the first time.
